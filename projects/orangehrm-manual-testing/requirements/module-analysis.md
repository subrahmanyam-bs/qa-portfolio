### 3. Input Behavior Analysis
*Actual input combinations and resulting observations recorded during active testing.*

| Scenario Observed | Input | Actual Observation | Verified |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Both fields empty** | Username: (empty); Password: (empty) | Fails to submit; displays validation message "Required" below both the Username and Password fields. URL remains the same. | `Verified` |
| **Username only** | Username: "Admin"; Password: (empty) | Fails to submit; displays validation message "Required" below the Password field only. URL remains the same. | `Verified` |
| **Password only** | Username: (empty); Password: Demo credential (not stored) | Fails to submit; displays validation message "Required" below the Username field only. URL remains the same. | `Verified` |
| **Invalid credentials** | Username: "InvalidUser"; Password: "wrongpass123" | Fails to login; displays alert banner with text "Invalid credentials" at the top of the form. URL remains the same. | `Verified` |
| **Valid credentials** | Username: Demo Admin account; Password: Demo credential (not stored) | Successfully logs in; redirects user to the dashboard page. | `Verified` |

### 4. Navigation Analysis
- **Login page URL**: `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login` (Verified)
- **Destination after successful login**: `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/dashboard/index` with page title "OrangeHRM" and topbar header breadcrumb text "Dashboard" (Verified)
- **Logout behavior**: Clicking the user dropdown tab (`oxd-userdropdown-tab`) and selecting "Logout" redirects the user back to the login page (Verified)
- **Destination after logout**: `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login` with login input fields visible again (Verified)
- **Other navigation observed**: After logout, clicking the browser Back button resulted in the Login page being displayed at the login URL (`https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login`). No Dashboard page was displayed during this observation. (Verified)

### 5. Validation Analysis
*Actual validations observed on input submission.*

| Input Condition | Action | Actual Message/Behavior | Location of Message | Observed During Exploration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Username and/or Password blank | Click "Login" | Displays text message "Required" | Span element `oxd-input-group__message` immediately below the corresponding input field | Yes — observed during exploration |
| Invalid credentials | Click "Login" | Displays alert banner with text "Invalid credentials" | Div element `oxd-alert-content` at the top of the login container | Yes — observed during exploration |

### 6. Authentication Behavior
- **Post-logout navigation behavior (external observation)**: After logout, clicking the browser Back button resulted in the Login page being displayed at the login URL. No Dashboard page was displayed during this observation. (Verified)
- **Lockout behavior (external observation)**: No account lockout or login restriction was observed after five consecutive failed login attempts on the public demo environment. The user was able to log in successfully and immediately with valid credentials on the sixth attempt. (Verified)
- **Remember me/session retention**: The active session persists across page refreshes. Additionally, the user session is synchronized across browser tabs; logging out in one tab invalidates the session in other tabs, redirecting the user back to the login screen upon their next interaction. (Verified)

### 7. Risks and Open Questions

#### Observed Risks
No functional or behavioral risks were identified from the Login module exploration itself.
Environment-level risks (shared demo instance, availability) are tracked separately under
"Testing Risks" below.

#### Testing Risks
- **Shared/Public Environment**: The shared/public demo environment may be modified or reset independently of this testing activity, which may affect test reproducibility.
- **Environment Availability**: The public demo environment may experience downtime, slow responses, or unexpected resets that could interrupt testing.

#### Open Questions
- What is the default lockout threshold for failed login attempts?
- Are there session timeout limitations on active or inactive sessions?
- What are the formatting and character limitations for credentials?

### 8. Analysis Status
- **Status**: `Completed`

## PIM (Personnel Information Management) - Module Analysis

This section captures the functional components, user flows, business logic, validation rules, and risks identified during exploratory analysis of the Personnel Information Management (PIM) module.

### 1. Functional Areas
- **Employee List Page**: Main search dashboard used to query employee records using specific filters and view list grids.
- **Add Employee Page**: Multi-input creation form used to register new employee profiles.
- **Optional/Custom Configurations**: Configuration sub-menus to adjust fields, custom fields, data import, reporting methods, and termination reasons.
- **Reports Dashboard**: Sub-module used to define and generate custom employee profile reports.

**Exploratory evidence**: [explore_pim_list.png](../test-execution/screenshots/explore_pim_list.png) (Employee List Page), [explore_pim_add.png](../test-execution/screenshots/explore_pim_add.png) (Add Employee Page)

### 2. User Flows
- **Create Employee Profile**: Input names and ID, select profile image, and save.
- **Create Employee Profile with Login Credentials**: Input names, toggle the credentials switch, input credentials (username, password, matching confirmations), and save.
- **Search Employee Records**: Input filter criteria on the search card, click "Search", and verify the results grid.
- **Delete Employee Record**: Locate an employee, click the checkbox, click "Delete Selected" in the table header, and confirm.

### 3. Business Rules
- **Mandatory Inputs**: `First Name` and `Last Name` are required fields. `Middle Name` is optional.
- **Employee ID Auto-Generation**: The system automatically generates a unique 4-digit Employee ID (e.g. `0488`) on page load. The ID can be manually overridden.
- **Profile Photo Input**: File selector accepts image formats (Type: `file`). Boundary resolution/size limits are unverified.
- **Login Credentials Toggle**: Activating the switch reveals three credentials fields (Username, Password, Confirm Password) and a Status radio toggle (Enabled/Disabled).

### 4. Validation Points
- Leaving `First Name` or `Last Name` empty triggers a red `"Required"` inline validation message under the respective field.
- Password complexity or short username entries during credential creation trigger validation errors in red text.

### 5. Risks and Open Questions
- **Shared Test Data**: Other public users can modify or delete created employee records, making specific searches fail if records are removed.
- **Auto-generated ID collision**: Overriding the auto-generated ID manually with an existing ID could trigger a primary key collision error.

## Leave - Module Analysis

This section captures the functional components, user flows, business logic, validation rules, and risks identified during exploratory analysis of the Leave Module.

### 1. Functional Areas
- **Leave List Dashboard**: Used to search and filter through employee leave history (From/To dates, status filters, Leave Type, Employee Name).
- **Assign Leave Page**: Administrative panel to allocate leave manually to a selected employee.
- **My Leave List**: Personal dashboard for employees to view their active leave status.
- **Leave Entitlements**: Section to add or configure leave balances per employee or group.

**Exploratory evidence**: [explore_leave_list.png](../test-execution/screenshots/explore_leave_list.png) (Leave List Dashboard), [explore_leave_assign.png](../test-execution/screenshots/explore_leave_assign.png) (Assign Leave Page), [explore_leave_apply.png](../test-execution/screenshots/explore_leave_apply.png) (My Leave List / apply flow)

### 2. User Flows
- **Assigning Leave**: Enter Employee Name, select Leave Type, input date range (From Date, To Date), check Leave Balance (read-only), add Comments, and click Assign.
- **Filtering Leave List**: Select date range, select status checkboxes (Rejected, Cancelled, Pending Approval, Scheduled, Taken), select Leave Type, input Employee Name, and click Search.

### 3. Business Rules
- **Employee Name Validation**: Must match a valid, existing employee record. Leaving it empty or typing a non-existent name triggers validation errors.
- **Leave Type Selector**: Mandatory select dropdown.
- **Date Format and Ordering**: The date format is strictly `yyyy-dd-mm` (Year-Day-Month). `From Date` must be less than or equal to `To Date`.
- **Date Inversion Validation**: Selecting a `From Date` that is after the `To Date` triggers a red validation message `"To date should be after from date"` (or similar).
- **Leave Balance Check**: A read-only balance label dynamically updates upon selecting an employee and Leave Type.

### 4. Validation Points
- **Inverted Dates Validation**: Selecting `From Date` later than `To Date` triggers a red warning: `"To date should be after from date"`.
- **Invalid Date Format Validation**: Entering strings not matching `yyyy-dd-mm` triggers a red warning: `"Should be a valid date in yyyy-dd-mm format"`.
- **Blank Required Inputs**: Submitting Assign Leave with blank mandatory fields triggers a red `"Required"` inline warning under each empty field.

### 5. Risks and Open Questions
- **Leave Overlap Policy**: System constraints on assigning leave on date ranges that overlap with existing records must be validated to ensure overlapping assignments are blocked.

## Admin - Module Analysis

This section captures the functional components, user flows, business logic, validation rules, and risks identified during exploratory analysis of the Admin Module.

### 1. Functional Areas
- **System Users Dashboard**: Used to search and filter system user accounts (by Username, User Role, Employee Name, and Status) and delete records from the grid.
- **Add User Page**: Panel form to register new system credentials and assign them to an employee profile.
- **Organization & Configurations**: Configuration sections for structural job settings, qualifications, nationalities, corporate branding, and email configuration.

**Exploratory evidence**: [explore_admin_list.png](../test-execution/screenshots/explore_admin_list.png) (System Users Dashboard), [explore_admin_add.png](../test-execution/screenshots/explore_admin_add.png) (Add User Page)

### 2. User Flows
- **Add System User**: Select User Role (Admin/ESS), autocomplete select Employee Name, select Status (Enabled/Disabled), input unique Username, enter Password, confirm password, and click Save.
- **Filter System Users**: Input username, dropdown select user role and status, autocomplete select employee name, and click Search.

### 3. Business Rules
- **Mandatory Fields**: All inputs on the user registration form (User Role, Employee Name, Status, Username, Password, Confirm Password) are mandatory.
- **Employee Name Selection**: Autocomplete search that requires matching an existing employee profile in the system database.
- **Username Uniqueness**: Usernames must be unique in the system database. Duplicate names are rejected.
- **Password Strength**: Minimum 8-character length limit. Mismatched confirmation strings are rejected.

### 4. Validation Points
- **Blank Required Inputs**: Clicking Save with empty inputs triggers a red `"Required"` inline warning below each empty field.
- **Invalid Employee Lookup**: Entering an invalid or non-matching name in Employee Name triggers `"Invalid"` autocomplete warning.
- **Password Warnings**: Passwords under 8 characters or confirmation mismatch strings trigger red validation warnings under the password inputs.

### 5. Risks and Open Questions
- **Username Collision**: Registering a username that already exists in the system will fail with an error. Test runs must generate unique timestamped usernames to prevent collisions.
